# RNA-Popgen-Notebook
Jupyter notebook for RNA evolutionary algorithm and subsequent population genetics and BioPython tools.

This notebook takes you from building populations using RNA structure-function as a model for evolving populations to studying these evolved populations using some basic population genetics tools.

The file `Population_Genetics_work.ipynb` has '...' placeholders where you can fill in the code yourself if you want to get some programming practice. The file `Population_Genetics.ipynb` is the fully coded version. You will find an implementation of the Nussinov RNA folding algorithm in the file `fold.py`.
